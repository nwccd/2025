Point System - Social Media Platform with Likes and Hearts

Overall system
Each cabin will create a profile picture for their cabin. 
Each profile picture must have the following:
Name for the Cabin
A picture of the Cabin’s mascot
A short bio of the cabin’s mascot
Favorite color
Favorite food
Favorite video game/app
The cabins of opposite gender will war against one another to get more points. HS girls v HS boys, MS girls v MS boys, ES girls v ES boys. 
Whichever cabin gets the most points will receive a trophy or medal (at each age cabin level). 
The overall winner (most points) will receive the bragging rights of the NWCCD Trophy. 

Points
Stickers of Thumbs Ups and Hearts
Thumbs up are worth 5 points. Hearts are worth 10 points. After being collected, they must be stuck onto the “profiles”. To be used as points - sharpies are used to cross them out. 

How to collect points...
Win nightly challenge versus opposing gender cabin
Cabin selfie of the day! Daily at lunch. 
Memory verses (entire cabin must recite the verse to a DPT member)
Cabins. Will be observed daily starting Monday and ending on Thursday. Most clean and most creative design will be awarded. Messy cabins will be penalized by losing points.
Games and activities throughout the day will have opportunities for cabins to collect rewards.
Fishing: if you catch fishes then you earn points.
Setting up the tables and clean-up for meal times will award rewards. Please note that your cabin should be on time and do quality work with a good attitude. 
Collecting the most water balloon debris will award rewards. 
Good sportsmanship acts and kind acts will also be awarded. 
Poor sportsmanship acts and being late will result in a penalty. 
Campers will have opportunities to collect rewards during class time.

Winning...
Elem girls v Elem boys, MS girls v MS boys, HS girls v HS boys. Altogether: Boys v Girls
There will be one cabin winner in each age group and the prize will be given after Water Fest.
Prize - bucket of ice cold water dumped on an opposing gender cabin staff of choice. 
Cabin with the most points wins the camp trophy.

What can you use points for?
Popsicle sticks for building the roller coaster- 5 is worth 5 points, 10 is worth 10 points, and so on. 
Roller coaster materials - hot glue sticks
